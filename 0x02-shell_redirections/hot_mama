A mother is your first friend, your best friend, your forever friend.
When you are looking at your mother, you are looking at the purest love you will ever know.
Mother is the heartbeat in the home; and without her, there seems to be no heartthrob.
My Mother: She is beautiful, softened at the edges and tempered with a spine of steel. I want to grow old and be like her.
